# Unsupervised-Learning: Clustering Analysis of Population Datasets

This repository explores unsupervised clustering techniques on four synthetic datasets (pop1.csv, pop2.csv, pop3.csv, and pop4.csv).

The project implements and compares two clustering approaches:

	•	K-Means Clustering (with evaluation using Elbow and Silhouette methods)
	
	•	Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) (with evaluation using the Bayesian Information Criterion, BIC)

It also provides a visual and analytical comparison between the results from K-Means and GMMs.
